    "synopsis": "After Kite and Quinton discover that Ninja Shadow Mosquito is literally as small as a mosquito, Scritch uses its ability to make Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon attack Quinton. Meanwhile, Kite is affected by a mosquito bite he received from Scritch during his journey, which is causing him to confuse his allies with his enemies. Recalling his training days with him, Quinton manages to awaken Kite's inner fire and break him free of the Scritch's influence. With help from Quinton, Kite manages to power up Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon and defeat Scritch, and obtain his Number card.

    "synopsis": "Arriving in Astral World, Yuma is guided by a Rainbow Kuriboh Kazuma built towards a strange town, where he is attacked by a strange being named Eliphas. Escaping thanks to Rainbow Kuriboh, Yuma receives a message from Kazuma, telling him to save Astral. Meanwhile, Shark, who is conflicted between his childhood memories and Barian memories, is approached by Dumon, who reveals to Shark that he is one of the Seven Barian Emperors, Nash. Yuma is rescued by an Astral being named Ena, who states Yuma can use the power of Chaos to restore the damage done to Astral World, and help its people fight against Eliphas, who has put the town under his control. With Ena's help, Yuma finds where Astral is laying, with Eliphas standing in his way. As the two begin to duel, Eliphas summons his Xyz monster, New Order 4: Etheric Anubis, while Yuma summons Utopia. However, Yuma is soon pushed into a corner when Eliphas exhibits the ability to perform a Shining Draw. ",
