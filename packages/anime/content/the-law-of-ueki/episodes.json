However, Ueki still has two. Just as Ueki feels defeated, Ai calls to him and Ueki finds his will: the will to protect his friends. His Maoh finally overpowers Hanon's, and Hanon runs out of Maoh. As a reward, he spits out Robert. Without Robert, however, he can no longer use Roberts power. He explains why he spits him out. With Robert, Hanon was limited by how many Zai Robert had. Now that he has been spit out, he is no longer limited in the number of Zai. This is unlike Ueki, who is not technically fighting a competitor of the tournament. And because he only has 18 Zai left, Ueki only has 18 chances to take out Hanon.",
