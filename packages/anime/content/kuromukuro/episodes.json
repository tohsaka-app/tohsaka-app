Research Institute is told by a teacher that her daughter Yukina is failing and has few career prospects, but she blames the school for the poor grades. After school, Yukina and Mika go to the Research Institute near Kurobe Dam where their parents work. Meanwhile the Ministry of Defense detects a meteor-like object heading for Japan that breaks up and pieces fall between Nagano and Toyama. Yukina daydreams of when she was little girl and her father told her that demons would return to earth. Mr. Aramata shows her a large black cube and a gigantic mecha type object found while excavating for the dam 60 years ago. At that moment, one of the pieces from space crashes near the U.N. Research Institute and a large number of small mecha attack the facility followed by one huge rose-colored mecha. The facility sends one-man battle units to fight them and Director Hiromi Shirahane authorizes two GAUS units to fight the huge mecha. Yukina touches a glowing red section on the cube which springs open, revealing a naked young man, Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma. He kneels before her and calls her princess. He then attacks and defeats one of the small mecha that entered the building while the two GAUS units manage to defeat the huge mecha outside. Kennosuke is then shot with a tranquilizer dart by security guards.",
