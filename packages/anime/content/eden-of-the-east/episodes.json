However, in order to cover his involvement, Takizawa took responsibility for Careless Monday and shipped the NEETs to Dubai for three months to keep them out of the public eye. Out of guilt and despair for what had happened, Takizawa erased his memories. After analyzing the data, Eden discovers that the missiles are targetted all over Japan, including the multiplex. Takizawa then contacts all of the NEETs and tells them he has arranged a bigger missile attack, and instructs them to figure out the best way to intercept the missiles and upload it to Eden.
