    "synopsis": "Honami travels throughout the city, writing runes in her blood for the dragon summoning ceremony. Nekoyashiki explains to the remaining Astral members that Itsuki's father, Tsukasa Iba, chose for Astral's headquarters to be in the city in order to keep watch over the dragon, and he casts a spell to retrieve Honami and Itsuki. Elsewhere, Adelicia confronts Fin, who overwhelms her with his magic. Itsuki and Sekiren arrive and Fin quickly disables the latter. Fin reveals that he is a changeling and possesses the Glamsight, which knocks Itsuki unconscious. Nekoyakishi's spell reaches Itsuki, Sekiren, and Adelicia, but Fin disrupts it, causing the spell to leave Itsuki behind. Honami and Fin take Itsuki to a tower, where they begin to summon the dragon. Nekoyakishi surmises the dragon is a sacrifice to heal Itsuki's eye, and that Honami feels guilt over exposing Itsuki's Glamsight to damage from the dragon when they were traveling in a mansion as children.

Nekoyashiki arrives first, but is stopped by Fin's and Honami's combined efforts. Adelicia enters the battle and summons Asmodai, her most powerful demon, and Honami responds with one of her most powerful spells. Nekoyashiki stops the confrontation to prevent the area from being destroyed from the accumulation of energy. Itsuki awakens, revealing his Glamsight and admitting to Honami that he does not blame her for their childhood incident with the dragon. Itsuki and Fin battle, and as Fin conjures an unblockable attack, Honami betrays him, declaring her love for Itsuki. The Association members, headed by Kagezaki, begin to arrive on the scene, and Fin retreats. Due to Fin's betrayal of the Association and a lack of evidence against Astral, the Association acquits Astral of any wrongdoing. Afterwards, Itsuki and Honami go to see the dragon before it is sealed, and upon its request, Itsuki names it \"Astral.\" ",
