    "synopsis": "The story begins with our tomboyish heroine Pollyanna Whittier eager to seize the day without a care in the world as usual with her companion chipmunk -- this time with a foot race to the crest of a nearby hill. As could be predicted from the acclivity course, Pollyanna is not prepared for the subsequent declivity at whose nadir grows a group of flowers that helps to mitigate the damage from the rough landing; an impromptu tribute offering to Pollyanna's late mother Jennie gives way to Pollyanna's father Pastor John Whittier summoning his daughter for breakfast complete with an innovative example of his chosen style of family government. The itinerary for the day has as its central feature the Pastor presiding over a meeting of the community group known as Ladies' Aid over a budgetary matter -- if the Pastor's thrombosis will behave for the duration of the meeting; thinking that she can help ensure smooth sailing, Pollyanna decides to peer in on the meeting only to find that one of the Lady Aides is not keen on live audiences!!! Pollyanna races off to rendezvous with her best friend Karen -- and into a lengthy harangue courtesy of Mrs. White that starts with the eavesdropping and deteriorates into a marital dispute of random destructive criticism that ultimately cares nothing of Pollyanna's concern for the Pastor's health nor the ice cream with which Mr. White greets Pollyanna; later that evening, the Pastor interjects his perspective on Pollyanna's frustration and has his daughter's greatest anxiety visited unto him.

    "synopsis": "Alerted to her father's cardiac distress by Chipmunk, Pollyanna's guilty reverie about not having been able to intercede earlier becomes the preamble for Mrs. White to demonstrate the veracity of the Pastor's sage counsel in response to Pollyanna's earlier frustration; galvanized by the novel insight and Mrs. White's encouragement to not blame herself, Pollyanna eagerly rises to the challenge of administrating Whittier-ke so that the Pastor can recuperate without any worries; unfortunately for all parties involved, the Pastor's health has not improved any even with Pollyanna's optimistic TLC catalyzed by the counsel and assistance of the Lady Aides. Karen recounting how she recovered from a cold much faster when she had access to her favorite food prompts Pollyanna to prosecute that very enterprise much to the anxious dismay of the Pastor and Mrs. White as there is a man-eating bear in the forest whose ravenous chase drives the two girls over a cliff to a ledge where the requisite strawberries are growing; the endemic parental scolding resolved, the dangerous gambit pays off when the Pastor's condition starts to improve. Pollyanna's courage and the Pastor's appreciation thereof is ultimately cold comfort to the whole episode of protracted downtime having driven home the proximity of the Pastor's depot destination when a black dress is discovered among the donated clothes; sure enough, the Pastor's coronary calamity has progressed to the point where the Pastor has just enough time to have Mr. White initiate his final arrangements and impart his concluding counsel for Pollyanna prior to his expiration.

Fortunately for Pollyanna, Polly does have some honorable compassion that is slightly greater than her volition for the perpetuation of the long-standing quiescent homeostasis as she replies for housing Pollyanna after having Nancy prepare a room in the attic. Galvanized by the data of having an aunt that is willing to take her in, Pollyanna has a dangerous opportunity before her with hefty stakes as she ultimately has to compute whether to stay or go; while Mr. and Mrs. White are both willing to support her either way, Pollyanna just might end up having bought a pig in a poke once she arrives in Beldingsville!!!

After some nocturnal computation about that engagement, Pollyanna reasons that John has probably led a lonesome life defined by protracted periods of having nobody to rely on for company mixed with a few incidences of dealing with the aftermath of treachery of ill-intentioned people that had approached him as a friend -- hence the frigid and hostile repulsion. Galvanized by her slightly better fortunes with the Miser on a rainy day, Pollyanna decides for greeting the Miser at every engagement as a side project concurrent with trying to befriend Jimmy who is gradually showing show some signs of warming up to her; unfortunately, Pollyanna's perseverance over the next ten days only serves to frustrate the Miser into blowing his stack -- and demonstrating that he has as much of a gold heart as a stone face.

Elated at Jimmy's agreement to aid in the search, Pollyanna remembers that the hill visible from her attic bedroom has many parallels to the hill in her former hometown; therefore, if Chipmunk has made that very conclusion, he will probably be sulking there.

It is not long before Pollyanna ultimately finds that her optimistic expectations are not reflective of reality as evidenced of a little girl named Mary who is frightened of the disadvantages of her upcoming surgery; charged the delivery of the bad news from Dr. Ames of a dismal 20% successful recovery probability based on the gathered medical data; the epilogue of whether Pollyanna ever gets her power-train successfully repaired depends on how dexterously Dr. Chilton delivers Pollyanna the bad news and prosecutes the complex repair job of resolving his collaborative prologue with Polly!!!

James and Governess Murphy are delighted at Pollyanna's visit as Ruth searches around for any data that confirms whether James is really her long-lost nephew; while she is unable to find any relevant data or to get Murphy-ke to accept her hand up, Ruth does decide to take a firmer stance in forcing Henry Dodge to better maintain all of the residential buildings owned by Carew-ke. Ruth cracking down on Henry Dodge's indolence is ultimately not enough of a consolation prize for Pollyanna as she then decides to entreat that James be given the option to be housed within Carew-ke since there is no decisive evidence against the equivalency; after hearing out Pollyanna's entreaties, Ruth secludes herself in her office to make a very difficult decision.

Astonished at the changes Ruth has undergone, Della is astounded when she has it explained that Ruth is summoning her for an executive engagement to express her frustration at James's current living conditions along with the lack of a conclusive apparatus to discern his identity as Jaime Kent -- a task that Della and Bridget cannot do when they accompany Ruth and Pollyanna to visit James who is recuperating alone in a much better-maintained apartment. In a bid to cheer up Ruth and place things in a healthy perspective, Della recounts Pollyanna's excitement about guiding Ruth through finding something to be glad about upon arriving in Boston before relaying Bridget's account about the prologue of Jaime's protracted absence; as such, Jaime is likely under better family government than James is at Murphy-ke and that everybody wins if Ruth houses James with her. Pollyanna and Murphy-ke are both ecstatic at Ruth's ultimate decision of concurrent residence with James; unfortunately for all relevant parties, Ruth's honesty about the anguishing absence of her nephew and her curriculum of enlightenment for James becomes of null utility when it drives home that her motives are not truly altruistic -- and that James has decided that such must never pay off for her!!!

Ruth prosecutes some cerebral computation over her prologue with Pollyanna that ultimately illuminates that she was far happier doing things for other people and decides for throwing a farewell party complete with a comprehensive sightseeing tour around Boston; while Pollyanna in her usual high spirits is nothing to mourn, one does have to wonder if Ruth and Pollyanna's guest lists mixing is a good idea.

The farewell party starts out well enough with Pollyanna and Sadie reconciling their differences about how they behaved toward each other when Chipmunk went missing before Ruth pipes up to suggest that Sadie accompany Pollyanna on the sightseeing tour around Boston after the party; no sooner does Sadie happily agree to this before something unexpected happens much to Ruth's astonishment and Pollyanna's delight: James and Mickey arriving on the scene to partake of the party . . . in convoy with all the other children from Murphy's Alley!!!
