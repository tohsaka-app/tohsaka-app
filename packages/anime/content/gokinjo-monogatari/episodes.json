    "synopsis": "The story begins with our heroine Mikako Kouda demonstrating how she bootstraps herself for the inception of another school day and even wielding her childhood friend and neighbor Tsutomu Yamaguchi in a crass culinary comedy as she eats breakfast. We then have it demonstrated that it is normal for Mikako's mother Ruriko to frequently behave as a dependent elder sister rather than as a mother a session of nocturnal manga synthesis. The apartment manager Noriji Sunami often likes to tease Mikako and Tsutomu prior to their school commute; once at Yazawa Geijyutsu Gakuen, Mikako's friends Risa Kanzaki and Mai \"P-chan\" Oota teasing Mikako becomes the forum for demonstrating that Sensei Hamada has no qualms about detaining Mikako after school for clumsy handiwork. Tsutomu's friends Yuusuke Tashiro and Jiro Nishino are excited about a euphoric diurnal engagement of karaoke with Mariko \"Body-ko\" Nakasu; frightened for the oblivious Tsutomu when Mariko disposes him, Mikako races off toward Hiroaki Tokumori's bar after imparting her stamp of approval. Hiroaki ultimately mediates the lover's quarrel and warns Tsutomu to focus more for quality rather than quantity after Mikako heads home only to be forced into a rainy-day layover with a stray cat during which she reminisces about her collaborative prologue with Tsutomu who comes to her rescue and escorts her home.

    "synopsis": "The euphoria of successfully having won over Noriji quickly gives way to a vivacious divergent concourse between Mikako and Tsutomu over what to name the kitten that she rescued that is only extinguished when Mikako has to quickly take responsibility for her cooking. A pair of star-struck schoolgirls accosting Tsutomu with a love letter during the commute to school and Risa's remarks about the convergent cerebral chemistry demonstrated in the situation along with P-chan's exhortation of an author's signature to a sentimental manga sets Mikako to wondering what infatuation is like; while Tsutomu reads the love letter from the schoolgirls, Yuusuke emphasizes the upcoming diurnal karaoke engagement that he and Jiro want to take place after school that day. Unable to accept that her anguish is because she loves him, Mikako does not respond well to Tsutomu suddenly aborting the shopping trip even though Tsutomu later tries to check in with her. Yuusuke and Jiro's subterfuge backfires on them when Tsutomu becomes the center of attention for the girls and becomes Mariko's infatuation; the ultimate irony is that it is Mikako's vindictive rejection of his apology and the adversarial divergent concourse that it ignites the next morning that inspires Tsutomu to unequivocally return Mariko's sentiments.

    "synopsis": "While prosecuting a series of practice stitches one night, Mikako reflects on the adversarial divergent concourse that she has visited upon Tsutomu whose honest mistakes she has lashed out against as malice only to find that she has become inattentive and clumsy with her work—the same inattention and clumsiness for which Sensei Hamada has detained her after school. The next morning finds that neither Ruriko nor Mikako has slept very much...and that Tsutomu has done some shopping for Kuro—the payload thereof delivered the day before. Deprived of ethical legitimacy, Mikako heads over to Tsutomu's place and acknowledges her fallibility. Tsutomu acknowledging his culpability gives way to accompanying Mikako in acquiring more pet supplies...that is, if Mariko had not exhorted Tsutomu's presence at her place at her convenience. While Mikako fumes at Tsutomu's »snub« and tries to wrap her mind around Tsutomu dating Mariko, Tsutomu superficially excavates into Mariko's prologue of finding the male libido rather than her character content as a person being the sole reason Mariko has been on so many dates. Tsutomu ultimately has more questions than answers as he tries to interpret the data he has seen regarding Mariko as he explains his perspective of Mariko as a misguided but not necessarily evil girl when Mikako is admonishing caution.

    "synopsis": "Even if she had kept it to herself, it is evident that Mikako is quite livid that Tsutomu has rejected her protective admonition about Mariko. Mikako's frustration is exponentially amplified with Hiroaki's perspective in Tsutomu's defense; unable to acknowledge her emotional fallibility, Mikako prosecutes an adversarial divergent concourse with Tsutomu prior to the school commute the next morning. Tsutomu's perspective of Mariko as a misguided person rather than a copulation milestone confounds both Yuusuke and Jiro when the boys set course for class; Mariko approaching Tsutomu with an entreaty for his lunchtime company inspires iconoclastic analytical concourse over the entire school. It seems that Mikako has interpreted Hiroaki's counsel as simply not allowing Tsutomu's activities with Mariko to affect her; this quickly becomes the elephant in the room but not by a large enough margin for Sensei Hamada to not detain Mikako after school. About the only silver lining is Tsutomu admiring Yuusuke's motorcycle before offering to escort Mikako home...or, he would have if not for Mariko's pre-emptive exhortation. Yuusuke volunteering himself becomes the preamble for him ironically falling for Mikako when she treats him to a »Thanks for the ride!!!« home-cooked meal; still, one has to ultimately wonder about the aftermath when everything is finally resolved.

Yuusuke is shocked to find that casually courting Mikako is easier said than done, especially when she is focused on her vendetta with the newly-arrived Mariko whose volition for Tsutomu is his company during a shopping trip. While Mikako prosecutes a a euphoric nocturnal engagement with Risa and P-chan where it is proposed to create a social circle from scratch, Ruriko converses with Hiroaki as she reminisces over her collaborative prologue with Mikako who once attempted a medically dangerous stunt as a child. Mikako gives the matter some serious thought and announces her decision the next morning —- a social circle that makes handmade items to sell at flea markets. The irony here lies in Jiro's inquiry of whether anybody can truly join cornering Mikako into a conundrum where her jealousy is the liability it actually is; fortunately, Mikako wisely demonstrates that her love for her new social circle is ultimately much greater than her hatred for Mariko as she races home past a very relieved Ruriko to get right to work.

Yuusuke calls on the exhausted Jiro the next morning for a meal due to having been caught with his micro-economic pants down while Mikako and Tsutomu prosecute their daily school commute while trying to fully awaken. While Mikako tabulates Tsutomu's fond recount of his karaoke concert for Mariko and her friends in preparation for an appropriate response, Yuusuke nearly dumps Jiro on the pavement in a mad dash to school where Mikako exhorts everybody to come up with a name for the social circle before the bell rings to signal the start of class. While the girls have the question answered as to what they will sell at the flea market, Yuusuke is at a loss for how to contribute to the flea market before discovering his proficiency in art; after an unsuccessful brainstorming session, the concourse gravitating toward the rationale for enrolling in Yazaku strikes a chord within Jiro who has been grappling with that very issue from the start. The deus ex machina solution to what to call the social circle, Jiro's contribution to the flea market, and the rationale behind Jiro's attendance at Yazaku lies in the dream sequence that explains his prologue of proficiency at playing video games and how a classmate named Chika Ishida suggested that he investigate how to program them after sharing her dream to be an akindo for tea.

It quickly becomes evident the next morning that the stress has overtaken Mikako when she immediately takes the boys' absence along with Mariko's as a personal affront and races off much to P-chan and Risa's shock; after having the situation explained to him, Hiroaki advises Mikako to put into perspective both the Akindo circle and her issues with Tsutomu's relationship with Mariko who Tsutomu explains has offered her apartment as Akindo headquarters. Mikako's relief at Tsutomu's dedication does very little to compensate for her vendetta with Mariko; a frenzied foot race later, Tsutomu explains his activities yesterday and Mikako acknowledges her fallibility. Upon returning to Mariko's apartment with the raw materials necessary for the accessories that she wishes to make, Mikako ultimately realizes why the word »assume« is spelled the way it is when she has it explained that Yuusuke and Jiro have been as busy as Tsutomu has been.

Once at the fairgrounds, Mikako wastes no time in taking charge much to Tsutomu's frustration and even counsels P-chan who has a bad case of stage fright. Mariko taking it upon herself to advertise the Akindo shop to help the other six members better do their thing obfuscates a little girl named Shizuka wandering around with an iconoclastic volition for Yuusuke to fulfill...that is, once he sees the folly in scaring away the customers; a brief adversarial divergent concourse later, Yuusuke sets course for a destination arcane that Shizuka promptly emulates only to find that Shizuka gives as good as she gets and insists upon the commerce she is more than willing to pay for while the other Akindo members have gotten back on track—especially since Mariko has brought back more merchandise. No sooner does Yuusuke get compensated for his commerce than Shizuka cries out a negation for her grandfather's company that conscripts him into a high stakes hide-and-go-seek game that requires the other Akindo members; upon having Shizuka's prologue explained to him, Yuusuke's contrition serves at the deus ex machina for Shizuka's reconciliation with her grandfather and for P-chan to do an excellent job of keeping shop to ultimately sell out everything.

Mikako's euphoria at being able to relax like a normal adolescent instead of having to cook and assist Ruriko with her work is quickly tempered not by Akindo failing to earn enough revenue to at least break even but that Hiroaki is accompanying Ruriko on her way home. Noriji immediately assumes that the two are paramours and tries to compute how to respond before deciding to tell a very frustrated Tsutomu who bursts out laughing at the prospect before daydreaming back to kindergarten when he observed Ruriko conversing with Hiroaki about his high school exams and concluding that Hiroaki having a crush on Ruriko is not really out of the question before deciding to go out for a walk. A demonstration of how Noriji concluded what he did panics Tsutomu into racing home and right into Mikako who forces his hand. As is usually the case, Noriji is clumsy with demonstrating his good intentions; the anguished Mikako hides herself away while Tsutomu frantically searches for her before recruiting Hiroaki to assist him—the deus ex machina of which is Mikako recalling her prologue with Hiroaki coming to fetch her from kindergarten when her mother had forgotten all about her along with Hiroaki coming to explain the whole situation.

Mikako ferociously dedicates herself to devising her counter-strategy that night even going so far as to repulse a dinner date with Ruriko; alas, this gambit is more pain than gain as Mikako collapses from sleep and food deprivation. Concerned about Mikako even though they are on opposite teams, Tsutomu rushes to the rescue and finds that Mikako has recovered herself into a collusive game plan with Yuusuke who has a much healthier perspective of the Festival and gains new insight about her. The next day, Yuusuke and Tsutomu end up availing the sprint time study as the vehicle to resolve their rivalry over Mikako only to end up as the anchors for the relay race. The ultimate irony of the relay race is that as badly as she wants her teammate Yuusuke to win, Mikako starts to realize that Tsutomu has already won her heart many times over. ",

While Mikako finds slim pickings in the job market, Ruriko talks things over with Hiroaki before cornering the newly-arrived Mikako into properly explaining her volition.

While Mikako computes an alternate strategy, Tsutomu leads her to the other Akindo members as they prosecute analytical concourse about how to conduct better commerce at the flea market. While everybody groans at the idea of Mariko exhibiting herself for publicity, Shintaro surprises everybody by volunteering to sell the new series of haniwa art he has been developing. The Akindo members detect Mikako's disrupted homeostasis during their reconnaissance around the flea market that ends with a visit to Chishou who demonstrates what an excellent merchant she is. Chishou is grateful for the extra commerce converging upon her but also detects Mikako's disrupted homeostasis regarding Tsutomu; upon seeing that the refreshment run did not work so well, Chishou admonishes Mikako against being so hostile to Tsutomu before he decides to permanently vote with his feet as did her boyfriend. Mikako ultimately realizes that it is far better to lose a little of her pride than it is to drive Tsutomu away forever, especially when he has purchased the hairbands that she had her eye on. ",

The ultimate irony of the whole matter is that the one thing Mikako really wants that is worth a kiss is the return of Mikako's father -- something that Ruriko has decided to purge from her life. ",

    "synopsis": "All the adults thoroughly inebriated save for Noriji becomes the backdrop for Tsutomu to lead Mikako outside where the two adolescents compare notes about the party thus far; an awkward silence later, Mikako presents Tsutomu with a pair of hand-made pajamas (after Sensei Hamada grades them) and the motorbike key she has withheld from him. Tsutomu escorts Mikako back home to call it a night after giving her a locket of his design; Mikako's search through the photo albums becomes the forum of having the prologue of Mikako's father explained and emphasizes that she wants to have her father there if nothing more than his photos; as if by telepathy, this rouses Ruriko from her inebriated slumber to the epiphany that it would not be surprising if Tsutomu decided to make love to Mikako on the spot considering the circumstances -- a frightening prospect that sends Ruriko racing home to find Mikako taking a bath. The ironic deus ex machina is Mikako having placed in the locket a photo of herself as a child that her father has taken; Tsutomu quickly sees through Mikako's mirage and affirms his volition to assist Mikako in locating her father.

    "synopsis": "Aided by the prior data he has of Mikako's father, Tsutomu searches around for any recent publication that mentions the photography industry and gets a clue from a magazine in a bookstore while out for a drive one night. An elated Mikako is naturally overwhelmed at the data Tsutomu has gathered of Hirohiko Sakurada right down to the location and date of his upcoming photo exhibition during their school commute; a heap of ambivalent panicking during a lengthy train ride and a brief sightseeing session later, Tsutomu successfully locates the destination gallery but finds that its public debut is in two hours. Ruriko bootstraps herself for a diurnal outing as the two adolescents wait out that time period only to get a lucky backstage pass into Hirohiko's latest handiwork -- a specimen of which affirms Hirohiko's yearning for his child relative. The irony of the whole thing is that Mikako could have easily found Hirohiko's residence in the prefecture district and Hirohiko himself if she had not so hastily left the gallery for the beach; the ultimate deus ex machina is the signature that she has not used for the past three years that clues in Hirohiko to the presence of his long-lost daughter.

The most recent adversarial divergent concourse prosecuted between Yuusuke and Mariko making its advent at school obfuscates the concourse with Hirohiko taking a serious turn when the full scope of Ruriko's deception is illuminated. Anguished that Ruriko has been throwing her under the proverbial motor coach to accomplish her own purposes, Mikako breaks down crying as she demands insight of Hirohiko who acknowledges his human fallibility as he explains that he still loves her regardless of the circumstances between Ruriko and him. The only silver lining in all of this is that the excursion ultimately sets the stage for Ruriko to truly acknowledge the unconscionable fallibility of the family government that she has been practicing with Mikako.

Instead of voting with her feet against Ruriko, Mikako decides upon an asymmetrical school-home commute pattern where she takes her sweet time getting home from school. After P-chan compares notes with her over their mothers, Mikako decides to egress at another station and wander around the area -- only to be reminded of when her family government was a cohesive unit before stumbling onto Risa's workplace. The deus ex machina that ultimately gets Mikako back on track is Risa's uncanny sixth sense for the carnage of clumsy family government; a few phone calls and a heap of junk food purchases later, the party that follows reminds Mikako that she can always count on her friends in Akindo.

Concluding that five out of nine is better than nothing, Ayumi leads the other four Akindo members in arranging all the imported items as per their floor plan -- some of which is to Mariko and Yuusuke's comical detriment. Ayumi pre-empts Mikako exploding in frustration at Mariko and Yuusuke's conduct as she sets out with Yuusuke for some provisions; it seems that Ayumi has placed her affection for Yuusuke in perspective as a good friend instead of as a paramour. During a layover at the park, Yuusuke and Ayumi exchange perspectives about their philosophies on life and their plans for the future. Yuusuke shrugging off and repulsing her exhortations for his company sets Mariko to reflecting on her prologue of Sensei Tomada scolding her for her »play it by ear« attitude about her future; the ironic deus ex machina is that Mariko ultimately decides to take that counsel to heart by lashing out at Ayumi -- and Yuusuke promptly returning it back to her.

Mikako finds that Ruriko has prepared dinner for her when she gets home; while Mikako repulses Ruriko's goodwill dinner, Mariko finds that Shintaro has learned to give as good as he gets when she confronts him over his music that night. The next morning, Mikako sets out on her own after leaving behind a note and a meal for Ruriko; while Tsutomu prosecutes a scavenger hunt all over the city for Mikako, Ayumi is killing time with her dog Masshu after leaving Shintaro and P-chan to continue work on the studio. The ironic deus ex machina is that Shintaro's frustration at the whole situation with Akindo forcing him to do all the work prompting him to walk off the job becomes the forum for Mariko and Ayumi to resolve their differences once Masshu does a »Shintaro« on Ayumi. Mariko and Ayumi working together much to Yuusuke's surprise, Tsutomu eventually finding Mikako to deliver a stern admonition against her subterfuge, Mikako confessing that she has given up on her parents . . . those things ultimately do nothing to assuage the shock of Ruriko discovering Mikako's signature at Hirohiko's exhibit using her former surname.

Mikako computing for the correct solution since the subterfuge is not sustainable quickly takes a back seat to Mariko having buried the hatchet with Ayumi much to the astonishment of the other Akindo members. It is not long before Mariko's abrupt but well-planned orders begin to bear fruit as the Akindo members remark that Mariko should avail herself as an expertise consultant for a living. The Akindo members taking a recess for lunch is when it becomes evident that Ruriko is medically in a bad way -- Mikako not being much better off; while Jiro guides Mariko through using the computer, the other Akindo members continue working on the studio. Yuusuke repulsing Tsutomu's playful derision ultimately becomes the deus ex machina for encountering Shishou whose delivery of a dangerous opportunity for both Mikako and Risa expedites the Akindo members successfully finishing up the studio; the euphoria fools Mikako into living on borrowed time.

Tsutomu is not fooled by Mikako obfuscating her frustration with her family government with a fiery determination to make a star performance at the next flea market; while Tsutomu wonders what he can do, Hirohiko reminisces about the good old days when he and Ruriko were both raising Mikako together as he wonders how to bring that about once more. While Ruriko continues with her manga synthesis, Kuro senses that Ruriko is medically in a bad way but realizes that he cannot help Ruriko by himself; thanks to Mikako complying Tsutomu's time limit on beginning her home commute, Kuro effects an SOS rendezvous with Mikako who detects something amiss when she finds Ruriko's uneaten breakfast. Absent-mindedly repulsing Kuro's »Let us keep searching« exhibitionism ultimately becomes the ironic deus ex machina for Mikako to literally stumble over Ruriko -- and a very poignant warning about her maladaptive conduct.

This brings no relief to either Mikako who has yet to resolve her hidden issues with Ruriko; Noriji volunteering to fill out the paperwork and Yuusuke calling it a night obfuscates Mikako making a trip to the bathroom in which she is torn over whether to tell Hirohiko about what happened to Ruriko oblivious to Tsutomu having made the choice for her. The ironic silver lining in Mikako's protracted absence is that it has ultimately set the stage for Mikako to finally realize that she never had to go it alone and that Tsutomu has already demonstrated his promise of perpetual proximity and attentive availability many times over.

Mariko inadvertently ignites a divergent concourse with Yuusuke and storms away in frustration before Risa decides to go visit Ruriko by herself. As the other Akindo members get right to work, Mikako is finding that there is more wrong with Ruriko than the stomach ulcer when she has it explained that Ruriko has been harboring several anxieties and has proof of Mikako's subterfuge with Hirohiko. The air cleared between mother and daughter, Risa visiting with flowers helps with the tense ambiance of the already-stormy office politics between Ruriko and her editor; ironically, this becomes the forum for Ayumi to catalyze Yuusuke and Mariko's reconciliation. The deus ex machina that ultimately resolves things arrives in the form of Hirohiko paying a visit the next day; relieved of her parents' marital drama, Mikako jubilantly sets course for the Akindo studio with Tsutomu right on her heels.

While Ruriko customizes herself, Hirohiko takes upon himself the stewardship of escorting Ruriko after he sends Noriji and Hiroaki on their way to the flea market where the other Akindo members execute one transaction after another until a casually-dressed gentleman approaches Mikako to signal an interest in her merchandise after some iconoclastic analysis.
