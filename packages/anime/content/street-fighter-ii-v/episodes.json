The two of them have not seen each other in years, and so this is the reason Ken sends the letter. Ryu, after thinking about it, decides to go to America at Ken's request. When he arrives at the San Francisco airport, he finds Ken. The two of them then drive home to Ken's place, relax a bit, then go out for the night on Ken's motorcycle. They go into the pub called Mt. Fuji, where they beat up some military thugs who tried to fight them after Ken wooed one of their dates. Afterward, the leader of the military thugs, Guile, enters the bar and sees what Ryu and Ken have done to his men.",

Ken loses badly as well, and then Ken and Ryu travel to Hong Kong in hopes of improving their fighting skills (their defeat at the hands of Guile gave them that motivation).",

There, the old man practices a martial arts technique in front of Ryu, where he uses his ki to create a blue fireball from his hands. He swallows this fireball, and, after it explodes in his stomach, he's fine and back in good health. Ryu wants to learn how to do the technique the old man just did, and so he takes him to his shop where they can have privacy and practice the technique.

They get atop the vehicle of the guy that shot at them, unknown to the sniper. They arrive at another secret hideout of the Ashura, where one of their main headquarters appears to be. There, they are severely beaten by an evil man named Zochi. Zochi carries a chainsaw on his left hand, although it is never explained how he lost his left hand. Zochi, after realizing torture will not make Ryu and Ken tell him who they are \"supposedly\" working for (in truth, they are working for no one, but Zochi doesn't believe them), he puts Ryu in a chair, where he is tied up. Ryu attempts to wiggle himself out, but Zochi plans to cut Ryu's left arm off with his chainsaw to add to his \"collection\" of other left arms. Just as Zochi is about to do so, the alarm sounds as Dorai and the rest of the police who are with him enter the secret hideout, thanks to the tracker Dorai planted on Soong.\n\nDistracted by this, Ryu and Ken defeat Zochi and the other Ashura members in the room, much to the surprise of Dorai and the rest of the police with him when they enter the room. Sagat, at the end of the episode, is freed from prison in light of new evidence proving his innocence. Sagat asks Ryu to show him the scroll he got from master Yo.

    "synopsis": "Bison orders Ryu to focus his ki to do the Hadouken. Ryu keeps doing the Hadouken for quite a while, and Guile and Nash infiltrate the fortress to get inside and rescue Ken from Bison. Ken slowly but surely summons enough rage to use the Hadou-Shoryu to break the wall between him and Ryu. Ken, after breaking the wall, tries to convince Ryu to come with him, but Ryu doesn't answer, and stands there glaring evilly at Ken. Ken notices something is wrong with Ryu, but doesn't know what. The episode ends after that.",

    "synopsis": "Ryu and Ken fight each other in a heated battle. Ryu easily overpowers Ken, as Ken refuses to fight his best friend. However, Ken eventually hits Ryu in order to defend himself, at which point Bison tells Ken that he and Ryu were born to fight this fight. The fight goes on between Ryu and Ken after this, as Ken tries to convince Ryu to snap out of it, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Cammy enters Dorai's hospital room and attempts to make a final assassination attempt on him, when Fei Long emerges from under the cover and turns on the lights in the room. Fei Long and Cammy talk, then they battle each other for Dorai's life. Finally, Guile and Nash, having successfully infiltrated Shadowlaw fortress, go their separate ways to find Ken. Guile runs into Zangief along the way, and he initiates a fight with him.",

Fei Long and Cammy continue their fight, with Fei Long determined to protect Dorai from Cammy. Ryu and Ken continue their fight as well, with no signs of it coming to an end. Ken continues to try to convince Ryu to turn back to normal, though to no avail. Eventually, Nash fights his way into the control room of the fortress, where he finds Bison. He confronts Bison boldly, shooting a bullet into his heart. Bison uses his Psycho Power to render this bullet useless. Afterward, Bison attacks Nash relentlessly, and eventually chokes him. Nash doesn't survive the choke, and dies because of it.",

    "synopsis": "Ryu and Ken continue their fight, as always. Nash is killed by a choke-hold Bison puts on him. Guile eventually finds his way into the control room, where he finds his friend Charlie Nash dead from Bison. Guile, realizing Bison killed Nash, rushes in to attack him with an extreme rage. Bison uses his Psycho Power to blast Guile back to the entrance of the room, where Guile stays for quite a while. Meanwhile, Fei Long and Cammy continue to fight for the life of Dorai, although Fei Long reveals to Cammy that Shadowlaw had sent her to kill Dorai, because he kept foiling their plans. Cammy did not know she was hired by a Shadowlaw agent, and so she believes Fei Long's words. Cammy goes to the hotel room where Balrog is staying, and begins to question his motives. He eventually reveals to her that he set her up, pointing a gun at her. Just as he is about to kill her, Fei Long and Barrac bust the door down, and Cammy kicks Balrog's gun out of his hand while he is distracted by the intrusion. Barrac says Balrog is under arrest, but before he is arrested, Cammy attacks Balrog for tricking her, nearly killing him. She decides to hand him over to Fei Long, and also thanks him for telling the truth.",

    "synopsis": "Ryu and Ken finally finish their fight at the end of this episode by using the Hadou-Shoryu and the Hadouken against each other. The resulting blast of energy knocks the cyberchip off of Ryu's forehead, and thus he returns to normal. Guile gets back up from Bison's Psycho Power that he was previously hit with, and stands again to face him. Bison is amused by this, but sends Chun Li to fight Guile as he doesn't have time to fight Guile personally. Ryu and Ken eventually meet up with Guile and Chun Li in the control room of the fortress. Their reunion is short-lived, however, as Bison's eagle head transports Guile and Chun Li outside to continue their battle. It also teleports Ryu, Ken, and Bison into the focal point of the universe where all the power in the universe flows, although this is not seen until the next episode.",

    "synopsis": "Guile and Chun Li battle outside, while Ryu, Ken, and Bison in the focal point of the universe, basically just another dimension that Bison's eagle head sends them to. There, Ryu and Ken seem destined to lose, because of Bison's overwhelming Psycho Power. Ryu and Ken's fighting abilities are no match for Bison, and Guile is losing tremendously to Chun Li, since the cyberchip has made her a much more powerful opponent than she was without it. Bison uses his Psycho Crusher and Double Knee Press attacks to overpower Ryu and Ken, severely wounding both of them. They eventually find the strength needed to carry on thanks to their Hadou powers. Ken uses the Hadou-Shoryu to weaken Bison substantially (and this also knocked the cyberchip off Chun Li's head), allowing Ryu to finish him off with a Whirlwind Hurricane Kick, followed by a Rising Dragon Punch, and then finally a Hadouken. The Hadouken connected because Bison was distracted at the time, as he was charging for another Psycho Crusher attack. After Bison is gone, Ryu and Ken go back to America, then Ryu sails to an unknown location, though it is presumably his home in Japan.",
