Akiho goes to see an old man named Tetsuharu 'Doc' Fujita to try and get some new parts, but finds they are too expensive. Kaito asks shopkeeper Mizuka Irei to look into any weaknesses Doc may have so he can lower his prices. This leads Akiho to meet Doc's granddaughter, Junna Daitoku. Although Junna fails to be much help, Akiho manages to get the parts needed thanks to an advanced allowance and a promise that they'll pay with the prize money. After repairing the robot, Akiho and Kaito work on controlling it, with Kaito also having to deal with Akiho's 'elephant mouse syndrome', an ailment she got following an accident seven years ago in which time fasts forward for her. Noticing her fatigue, Kaito agrees to be the robot's operator on the condition that she makes the controls similar to his favourite game, Kill Ballad. ",

The tournament soon begins and Kaito manages to use his tactics to get through the preliminaries and into the finals. Before the final match, Akiho starts to grow concerned about Kaito, who hadn't gotten a lot of sleep prior to the tournament. The final match soon begins against the reigning champion, Mr. Pleiades, whose robot has some fierce tricks up its sleeve. While Kaito's robot is at a disadvantage against Subaru's, Kaito suddenly experiences an inverse of the ailment Akiho has, slowing down time for him, and makes a counterattack, knocking both of them out, though this technically results in Kaito's loss. Upon returning home, Kaito has a brief encounter with Kill Ballad's creator, Frau Koujirou. As the vice-principal prepares to disband the robotics club, Kaito manages to prove that Mr. Pleiades is in fact their classmate, Subaru Hidaka, meaning the school still technically won the Robo-One tournament, as per the vice-principal's request. With the Robotics Club's disbandment cancelled and Subaru forced to join in order to keep his secret safe from the public, Akiho sets her sights on enlisting help from JAXA to complete their giant robot.

Akiho questions Kimijima on whether Misaki still loves robots and he suggests that she still might, since she didn't stop playing Kill-Ballad. Akiho further vows that they will stop Kimijima and his plans using their giant robot and save Misaki whilst Sumio helps disarm Airi, who faints while Kimijima disappears. Back at the old JAXA hanger, Subaru, Junna, Nae and Tetsuharu, having seen Akiho's speech via Mitsuhiko's livestream, get together in order to fix up GunBuild-1. As the weather takes a turn for the worst, at Cape Kadokura, Misaki mourns Mizuka and tries to kill herself, in vain as Kimijima controls her movements via the exoskeletal suit she was forced into wearing. As the storm begins knocking out the power to various parts of the island, Kaito and the others along with Airi join everyone at the hanger after their jet crash lands at the airstrip. People begin taking refuge at Tanegashima Chou Highschool following the fake solar flare news as the Robotics Club deduce that they have until the rainstorm clears to finish modifying GunBuild-1 for battle with Misaki's Sumeragi and prevent Kimijima from launching the black hole bombs into space, killing billions. As Akiho assigns everyone tasks, Kona looks at the program Sawada gave to Kaito, \"DG297 3rd Edition ver.4.11\" since the Iru-O network controlled by Kimijima can no longer be trusted. Kaito decides he should leave and get the device Sawada gave him analyzed- an Electromagnetic wave emitter, which could be used to dispel illusions. As they begin their work at the hanger, they are approached by the vice-principal, who requests they reform the Robotics Club before they begin, and is soon joined by all the of Tanegashima Chou students, townsfolk and JAXA engineers who come to help. Meanwhile at the Tanegashima Space Center, Misaki holds back Kimijima's control long enough to help Ken'ichirō escape before using the last of her own free will to send Sister Centipede to deliver a Report Number 0 to Kaito and Akiho.

    "synopsis": "Whilst everyone else works on fixing up the GunBuild-1, Kaito, Nae and Airi head to Kimijima's lab to retrieve data for the device Sawada gave him, although Kaito undergoes a seizure when he attempts to activate it. Just then, they are confronted by some armed droids run by Kimijima and Sister Centipede. However, Sister Centipede manages to have the droids shoot each other, only to be erased by Kimijima shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, as Akiho and the others complete the GunBuild-1, which she renames the Super GunBuild-1, she reunites with Ken'ichirō before learning of Kaito's condition. Despite his injuries, Kaito insists that he be Super GunBuild-1's operator, believing that the device Sawada gave him can trigger his Slow-Mo at will, giving him a chance against the Sumeragi. Akiho objects, however, believing using the device could kill him. Kaito assures her that he will help her meet Misa face-to-face again, giving her the Slow-Mo trigger. On the day of the mission, Kaito confesses his love to Akiho and kisses her before setting off in the Super GunBuild-1. ",

    "synopsis": "Kaito arrives before Misaki, with the others helping to divert the missiles she fires using AR decoys, although Kaito is forced to use the Slow-Mo and sacrifice one of his pile bunkers to dodge the last one. Kaito manages to get up close to Misaki's Sumeragi and use the Slow-Mo to attack her with the other pile bunker. However, this knocks Misaki out and allows Kimijima to take full control of her as he divides the Sumeragi into a more mobile unit. After locking down the launch sequence, despite Nao and the other adults reclaming the control room, Kimijima launches an attack at the others forcing them to seperate, which leaves the Super Gunbuild-1 with only five minutes of power. Just then, Kona receives a program from Sawada that will erase Kimijima if they can get his avatar in the PokeCom's view, although it requires a reboot which leaves Kaito vulnerable. As Kimijima charges at Kaito, Akiho calls out to Misaki, who manages to hold off Kimijima's will long enough for Kaito to finish rebooting. Kaito manages to goad Misaki's consciousness into a fight, and uses one more Slow-Mo to land a hit, exposing her body. Akiho then manages to get her emotions through to Misaki, which gives Kaito the opportunity to use the program to erase Kimijima, freeing Misaki from his will and allowing Nao to stop the launch at the last second. As the gang return home to the cheers of their friends, they decide to aim high for whatever comes next. ",
