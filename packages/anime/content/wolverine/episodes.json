As Logan steals the power source, he runs into Omega Red and leaves him to die in a cave in the snow. In present day, Omega Red blames Wolverine for his pain because without the synthesizer, his body was vulnerable to biological attack. To buy time and escape, Logan throws a flammable container at Omega Red which explodes and destroys the dock. While resting in a vacant apartment, Wolverine senses an assassin. The assassin is really a decoy for Omega Red, who reappears with a severely burnt face, and pins Logan to the wall and knocks Yukio back.",

When the men go to sleep, Yukio frees herself with her weapon being on the wall, but is tranquilized when Kurohagi checks on the men.
