    "synopsis": "In another dimension, vampire and boss of the Demon World's Eastern District, Staz Charlie Blood lives as a normal otaku. Staz's second-in-command, Deck, informs him of their capture of a living human girl, Fuyumi Yanagi and brings her over to Staz's apartment. Upon meeting Fuyumi, Staz becomes infatuated and engages her in an otaku discussion. Meanwhile, Deck and the other gang members get into a fight with a challenger to Staz's leadership who wields demon plants. Deck calls Staz for help, who aids them after suppressing his vampiric urges from Fuyumi. Staz easily kills the challenger and when he and Deck return to the apartment they horrifically discover that Fuyumi had been killed by one of the rogue demon plants. After finding her bones and strangely enough, Fuyumi herself on Staz's bed, Deck deduces that she became a ghost and Starz resolves to resurrect her. Fuyumi later remembers how she stumbled into the Demon World and takes Staz to a back alley where they discover a rare dimensional portal known as the \"Black Curtain\". Staz stops Fuyumi from entering the portal, explaining its strange nature, before expressing a desire to visit the Human World himself. Staz then takes Fuyumi to a local cafe where he has the owners, Saty and Mame, determine the nature of her existence via their \"Third Eye\" magic. As Staz reveals his intention of going to the human world to a panicked Mame, Deck enters with a new gang recruit, Mimic Yoshida. Mame outlines the repercussions of Staz's departure but he compensates by making Mimic the new boss; who subsequently transforms into Staz's own likeness and they decide to use him as a body double in Staz's absence. Afterwards, at a welcoming party for Mimic, Fuyumi wonders if Staz can really resurrect her but Deck reassures that Staz sees his goals through.\nIn the epilogue, Staz and Fuyumi step through the Black Curtain.

Afterwards, Staz suggests that he enroll as a transfer student at Fuyumi's high school and they run into her upset father but Staz sprays him with his diluted saliva altering his behavior and explaining that it possesses the property of controlling humans. later, Staz enters into a fit of excitement while marveling at the human world, and upon arriving at Fuyumi's school, sprays its entire population with his saliva and allowing Fuyumi to fit in as if nothing happened. Although, she soon learns that the chemical only creates false memories, at which point, her body starts disappearing much to her shock. Staz has her suck some of his blood, which restores her demon existence. Afterwards, Staz finds himself strangely uninterested in sucking the blood of humans other than Fuyumi. Later they return to Fuyumi's house to discover a woman calling herself Hydra-Bell. Bell reveals that she didn't leave the \"Black Curtain\" out by choice and that she had known about Staz's doppelganger to which Staz deduces that she intends to blackmail him into giving up his territory, before she uses spatial magic to transport him to point in the human world and threatens to kill Fuyumi if he doesn't get an item from a demon clothing store for her. Afterwards, Hydra Bell explains that she had been looking for the person who stole the Black Curtain from her. Meanwhile, Staz enters into a pointless fight with the store owner, until Bell and Fuyumi show up and the latter explains that Bell had only been testing Staz, in her search for someone with powerful magic. Finally Bell reveals that the only thing capable of bringing Fuyumi back to life is \"The Book of Human Resurrection\" which she had sold to the boss of the Demon World's Western District: Wolf.",

Meanwhile, Bell still suspicious of Staz, continues to observe him. Staz and co. board a special demon carriage and end up meeting Wolf en route to another territorial battle. After a bit of casual rivalry, Staz tries to get Wolf to help him in obtaining the book which the latter deems too frivolous an exploit of his time. Seeing no other alternative, Staz proposes that they have a competition, with Wolf wagering to help Staz find the book should Staz win, and Staz wagering Fuyumi herself should Wolf win. Afterwards Staz starts preparing for a bowling competition, elaborating to Fuyumi, a plan to cheat using his manipulative magic although Wolf has a boxing match prepared instead. As they both step into the ring, Staz begins the fight with a clinch tactic but Wolf ends up dominating the rest of the match, believing that Staz would use up all of his magic healing his wounds. However in a dramatic turn of events, Wolf ends up being the one whose magic depletes since Staz had bitten him during their clinch and had been absorbing his magic ever since. As Staz starts gaining the upper hand, Wolf enters a partial werewolf transformation and begins patronizing Staz's motives of helping Fuyumi, claiming that Staz only uses his vampiric powers when it benefits him. This angers Staz to the point of almost killing Wolf with his ZIP spell, although the match is stopped by a tearful Fuyumi along with Bell who transports them all to another building. Here Bell reveals that she had the book all along and was merely toying with the group. Finally obtaining the book, Staz and co. try and fail to read its anagrammatic text, with the only person capable of deciphering it being the book's author which shocks Staz when he turns back to the first page.\nIn the epilogue, Staz grows terrified when he learns that the book's author is non other than his older brother and resident of the Demon World Acropolis: Braz D. Blood. ",

    "synopsis": "Staz's reluctance to visit Braz in Acropolis enrages Wolf who forces him to finish that which he had started while also threatening Bell to use her Spatial Magic to take Staz to Acropolis. Wolf then kicks Staz into a newly opened portal where he ends up in Bell's bedroom. Here Bell once again tries testing Staz but he instead questions her true motive. Bell reveals that Staz's magic acts as though it leaks out of a seal prompting him to explain his history with Braz. Staz explains that when he was younger, Braz conducted numerous torturous experiments on him for the purpose of sealing away his magic, which Braz had managed by shooting a bullet directly into his heart thus creating a seal that only he can remove. Upon learning this, Bell finally confirms that Staz isn't the magic thief since he simply wasn't powerful enough to steal her Black Curtain, but this only makes her more curious about Staz's true power. Bell then tries to provoke Staz by locking him in her spatial grid room until he promises to have Braz remove the seal. Staz agrees and states that when his seal is removed he will use his full magic power and actually steal her spatial magic. Afterwards Bell treats Staz to sushi and begins falling for him against her better judgement. Meanwhile, back in the Demon World, Fuyumi's body starts vanishing once more, prompting Wolf to hurriedly take her to the mad-scientist: Franken Stein. Finally Bell takes Staz to Acropolis and decides to cause some trouble to force him into breaking the magical seal. Staz decides to sneak into Braz's castle but ends up being caught by his little sister and Warden of the Demon World: Liz T. Blood who had disowned him because of his betrayal and imprisons him in the prison known as \"Liz's Toy Box\". Staz's fellow inmates then trick him into pushing a suspicious button in his cell which opens to a corridor.\nIn the epilogue, after being led to another room, Staz once again encounters Liz who explains that a prisoner can leave at any time they wish, providing they can defeat her zombie subordinates in battle; a feat which a single inmate has yet to accomplish.

Meanwhile Franken deduces that Fuyumi's condition can be stabilized with a dose of Staz's blood. He further explains to Wolf that ghosts have the unique ability of becoming a single demon species by absorbing their magic; digressing that if Fuyumi absorbs all of Staz's magic she may be able to rival another demon. Back in Acropolis, Braz learns of Staz's arrival and the Blood family reunites, with the former refusing to help Staz. After a little sibling rivalry involving Liz's envy of Braz's preference to Staz, Braz proposes Staz with a deal. Meanwhile, Bell reveals to an angered Wolf of Franken's hidden intention of using Fuyumi to combat a failed experiment called Artificial Demon No. 9: Akim Papradon, a monstrosity he created using bodily pieces of other demons. Seeking stronger parts however, Akim escaped from Franken's laboratory and began hunting demons. Wolf makes a deal with Franken that should he defeat Akim, he would return Fuyumi to being a regular ghost. Simultaneously, Braz explains the same matter to Staz, proposing to teach him the resurrection spell should he help defeat Akim, which the latter refuses. Braz continues that after unlocking Staz's tremendous magic power via his experiments, he was forced to seal it until a time when Staz could properly wield it. Refusing to have the seal removed, Braz has Liz's zombies beat Staz to the point of having to use his true power. Meanwhile, with Bell's help, Wolf arrives at the North District in his search for Akim and engages in a battle with the territory's boss. However, much to Wolf's horror, Akim suddenly appears by grotesquely ripping through the boss. Finally, as the zombies overwhelm Staz, Braz removes the bullet seal, awakening Staz's true power and thus allowing him to easily eradicate the zombies.\nIn the epilogue, Braz picks up the crushed boulder from the ground after telling Liz not to loose it, being a reminder of Staz's true power.

Meanwhile, Wolf and Akim begin their battle with the latter specializing in spatial magic. Much to Wolf's shock, Akim reveals that he is merely demon phantom manipulating the dead pieces of a physical body via magic. Wolf then releases the magic stored in his pipe and enters into a full werewolf transformation. Meanwhile, Bell traps Franken in the grid room, forcing him to reveal everything about Akim's spatial magic. Meanwhile, Wolf and Akim engage in fierce hand to hand combat, with the former supposedly emerging victorious after using his claws to slice Akim to pieces. At the same time, Staz shows up just as Akim starts putting his body back together and enters the battle by knocking Akim into the northern wasteland before switching with Wolf, whose magic completely depletes. Staz unleashes a barrage of magical punches against Akim, none of which connect due to the latter realizing Staz's reckless fighting style. Insulted, Staz releases his magic which takes the form of a large golden hand and annihilates Akim in one powerful attack. In the attack's wake, Staz allows Akim to piece himself back together, admitting that his power is a burden before seemingly killing Akim with his ZIP spell. Afterwards, Wolf approaches Staz and challenges him to a battle. Meanwhile, Bell delivers the pieces of Akim to Franken after having captured him whilst attempting to escape Staz's ZIP and questions them on Akim's spatial magic, learning that Franken had obtained Akim's core body with the spatial magic stolen from her by an unknown third party.

Afterwards the group heads back to the Third Eye Cafe after Braz makes a request to see Fuyumi's original body.
