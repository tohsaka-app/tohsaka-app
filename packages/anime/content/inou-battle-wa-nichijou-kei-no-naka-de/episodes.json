Six months later, each of the club members have since developed their own superpowers, which they put to the test in their monthly check-up. When student council member Mirei Kudou comes to check on the club, she ends up misinterpreting Jurai's chunibyo behavior and inadvertently reveals that she herself has developed superpowers as well. Mirei challenges the club to a superpower battle, using her own ability to steal Jurai's \"Dark and Dark\" ability, only to find it to be nothing more than a useless lukewarm flame. With the other members knowing not to show off their powers before her, they easily beat Mirei in a physical match. Learning that Mirei learned of the club's powers from an anonymous text, the group become curious about just who sent it. ",
