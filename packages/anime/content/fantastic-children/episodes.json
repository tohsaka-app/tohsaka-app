We switch focus several times as we follow the Children throughout history - in Holland, where their attempts to convince a young boy called Conrad to join them fail after they send him a postcard depicting a strange image, to Sweden at the turn of the century, and to the South Eastern Islands where they arrive too late at the bedside of a dead woman named Serafine who has been painting the same image as on the postcard. Strangely, one of the Children, Mel suffers amnesia and panics, getting captured by the strange young man Duma and his cronies while the other Children escape.\n\nFast-forward to 2012 in the Islands, and the roguish Toma practices his martial arts before discovering a young girl, Helga, lying on a statue silently. He visits his mother, a bogus fortune teller, and helps a young thief, Chit, escape his pursuers, before returning home to see Helga being taken away by some mysterious men...",
