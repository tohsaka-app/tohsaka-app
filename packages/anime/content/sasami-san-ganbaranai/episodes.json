    "synopsis": "Sasami writes up a report explaining that the chocolate incident was the result of powerful gods appeasing to the wishes of Kamiomi, who unknowingly possesses the powers of the goddess Amaterasu. Meanwhile, many students are absent from school due to becoming engrossed in a fantasy social game. Intrigued by it, Kamiomi and the Yagami sisters borrow Sasami's spare computers to try it for themselves. Sasami, not wanting them to find something wrong with the game and shut it down, preventing her from playing it anymore, tries to interfere with their gaming to no avail and she inevitably reveals herself as a player while attempting to stop their tomfoolery. When a strange dark dragon suddenly appears, absorbing the spirits of all the players, everyone's minds end up getting sucked inside the game itself. The dragon is revealed to be something Sasami created three years ago when she once possessed the power of Amaterasu, which kept the game from being shut down. Coming to understand this, Sasami relieves the dragon of its duty, shutting down the game and returning everyone to the real world. ",

She soon began to question her life after discovering the internet, eventually deciding to run away with Kamiomi. As she writes her report, Sasami discovers that a third arm has grown out of her chest, soon discovering it has a personality of its own, which tells him Kamiomi plans to return to the shrine in order to protect her from hunters who want Amaterasu's power. Struggling against the sunlight, Sasami comes across Tsurugi, who brings her to Tsukuyomi Shrine and reveals herself to be Amaterasu herself, who gave her power to Sasami's ancestors long ago. As Tama and Kagami arrive to attack the shrine, Tsurugi explains how she created them from parts of herself. Sasami soon learns that Kamiomi had been kicked out of the shrine as he had no divinity, realising she still had the power of Amaterasu all along, with the Gods granting Kamiomi's wishes as part of Sasami's wish to make him happy.

As Sasami in the video winds up at a mini live concert, it turns out to be a trap set up by the Tsukuyomi Shrine, in which Sasami's father stabs her third arm and allegedly steals her power of Amaterasu. The video soon reaches its climax involving an all out battle between the shrine, the Yagami sisters and government forces trying to obtain an alien Tama came across.

Sarcoma objects to being forced to return to Sasami's body, but Tsurugi takes away her power before she can object. Tsurugi returns Amaterasu's power to Sasami whilst also turning the sarcoma into a rabbit for Kagami to keep. ",
