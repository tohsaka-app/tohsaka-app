    "synopsis": "The Ushiromiya family gathers on Rokkenjima, a small island off the coast of Japan, for their annual family conference to discuss how the inheritance of the ailing family head, Kinzo, will be distributed among his children and their spouses. Battler, who has not attended the conference in six years, notices a new painting in the foyer of the mansion. He is told that it is a portrait of the \"Golden Witch\" Beatrice, who had supposedly given Kinzo all his wealth, and who Kinzo desires to see again. Battler, however, does not believe in witches or magic, and doubts she exists. A typhoon approaches the island, and Maria is left outside by her mother Rosa while searching for a wilted rose George had marked for her in the garden. When it begins to rain, Battler, Jessica, George, and Rosa go outside to find Maria with an umbrella she did not have before, which Maria says Beatrice gave her. ",

The rest of the night has the adults staying up still discussing the family inheritance while the children retreat to the guesthouse. That night, George gives Shannon an engagement ring, and asks her to give her reply the next day. The following morning, six people have gone missing, and Natsuhi is informed of a strange symbol drawn on the outdoor tool shed. When she goes to investigate with Kanon and Genji, they find the missing six people brutally murdered inside. After Genji goes to fetch Dr. Nanjo to inspect the bodies, Battler, Jessica and George follow and see the horrific scene themselves.

The three primary suspects are the servants, who have access to the entire mansion; Natsuhi, who was the last person seen with Kinzo; and Eva, who has the most to gain from the murders. However, after a heated argument between Natsuhi and Eva, they are unable to come to a definitive answer and return to their rooms.

In 1986, the cousins are informed of Kinzo's test from the hostages in Kuwadorian and are forced to lock Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse to keep them from interfering. Jessica and George are individually tested by Ronove and Gaap, respectively, and instructed to choose which of the islanders will be next to die: themselves, their true loves (Shannon for George and Kanon for Jessica), or everyone else. Jessica chooses herself for Kanon's sake so that he may live his life to the fullest, while George chooses everyone else as he is willing to go so far for his love for Shannon to be accepted. Unwilling to leave the hostages in the dungeon, however, Jessica and George defiantly engage their respective demons in combat. ",

    "synopsis": "Jessica and George are about to land their final blows on their opponents when Gaap teleports the two into each other, killing them both as their attacks collide. Temporarily resurrected by Ronove as a favor, Jessica calls Battler at the guesthouse to warn him of their enemies. Meanwhile, the hostages are able to break out of Kuwadorian, but are killed off one by one on their way to the mansion until only Kyrie remains. Before she too is killed, Kyrie calls Battler as well and tells him to believe in witches. Afterward, Maria is sent off to take her test when Battler receives another phone call, this time from the newly revived Beatrice, and goes to meet her at the mansion entrance, discovering Gohda and Kumasawa dead in the storehouse on his way there. Beatrice gives Battler his test: to remember a sin he committed six years ago. However, Battler is clueless as to what that may be, much to Beatrice's frustration, prompting her to take her anger out on Kinzo by spontaneously killing him. Having lost her interest in the game, Beatrice decides to suspend it by deeming Battler unqualified to be her opponent, revealing that his birth mother was not Rudolf's first wife Asumu as he had believed, and claiming that he is not Kinzo's grandson Battler, the only one eligible to fight her. Questioning his own identity, Battler fades away, and Beatrice retires to the newly opened Golden Land with Maria. ",

    "synopsis": "Ange enters the Golden Land where she happily reunites Maria with Sakutaro and forces Beatrice to continue the game. Battler, however, has lost his soul due to his uncertainty of his own identity. Desperate to revive Battler, Ange confirms his qualifications as Kinzo's grandson, and reveals her own identity as his sister to him, successfully restoring him. Having broken the most important rule as a piece in the game to keep her identity a secret, however, Ange dies. With Battler's resolve strengthened and Beatrice realizing she cannot escape the game, the two engage each other in their final confrontation, with Battler's blue truth against Beatrice's red truth. Kinzo's spirit appears to protect Beatrice, but Battler dispels him in blue by confirming his death not only at the start of the fourth game, but every game thus far; however, Beatrice confirms in red that there are actually no more than seventeen people on Rokkenjima. Nevertheless, Battler manages to explain all four games through human means, while Beatrice is left completely skewered by his blue truth, but unable to die. Beatrice begs Battler to kill her and presents him the last mystery she is able to give: since Battler is the only person left alive on the island, and yet Beatrice is also there to kill him, Beatrice asks, \"Who am I?\" Understanding Beatrice's plight, Battler promises to solve her final mystery and put an end to her suffering. Bernkanstel and Lambdadelta, however, intend to keep Beatrice in the game, torturing her for eternity. ",
