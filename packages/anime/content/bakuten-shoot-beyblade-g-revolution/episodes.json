The boys find that the BEGA building is unparalleled in the quality of its Beyblade training and facilities. Impressive as it is however, Tyson is still highly distrustful of Boris, who was responsible for trying to take over the world two years ago by using his team the Demolition Boys as soldiers. Boris tries to convince Tyson that he’s changed. Ever since his scheme was uncovered, he roamed throughout his homeland doing some soul searching. There, while watching some village children Beyblade, he had an epiphany. He realized that Beyblading is all about honor and individuality, and he made it his new goal to bring Beyblading to the masses. That’s why he took over the BBA and turned it into BEGA – as a way to give children around the world that had no exposure to the game a chance to better their lives and become champions themselves. Tyson is still skeptical, and his bad-mouthing of Boris draws the ire of a top BEGA prospect – a juggernaut named Crusher, whose Beyblade launcher is the biggest one the boys have ever seen. When grilled by Tyson about his motives for joining this professional league, Crusher admits he’s doing it for the prospect of getting rich, but only so he can afford to pay his younger sister’s hospital bills. A Beybattle ensues, and Crusher shows he’s even more powerful than he looks. Tyson is nearly defeated, but he summons his will and narrowly defeats his jumbo-sized opponent. When Boris asks Tyson if he now believes he’s sincere in his reasons for creating BEGA, Tyson still isn’t sure.

    "synopsis": "It’s mid-way through Tyson and Brooklyn’s final tie-breaking ‘Justice 5’ match which could give BEGA a stranglehold on the entire sport of Beyblading. Having suffered his only previous defeat at the hands of Kai, Brooklyn’s thirst for revenge takes the form of an unearthly power. Not only has his Beyblade Zeus given Brooklyn sinister black wings with which to fly, it has generated a giant vortex in the sky that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are crumbling everywhere. The entire world is being enveloped by the growing darkness. Only Tyson can stop Brooklyn before it’s too late. Summoning his own formidable power from Dragoon, Tyson flies into the sky to convince Brooklyn to cease the negative emotions that are causing the havoc. When reasoning fails, the pair continues their battle above the ever-crumbling city. The tide turns in Tyson’s favor when he is able to summon the spirits of his teammates’ blades and merge them with Dragoon, which evolves into the most powerful Beyblade ever. By probing deeper into Brooklyn’s psyche, Tyson learns that his foe's anxiety stems from childhood isolation at being a genius so early in life. Tyson makes Brooklyn see that Beyblading is a pure sport to be enjoyed for one reason alone – the love of the game. Brooklyn calms down. The chaos ends. And the pair continues their match simply for enjoyment. With BEGA's HQ in shambles, the upstart league and its owner Boris are ruined. Mr. Dickenson’s BBA league restarts, but in a much more modest form.
