Normally, humans and Giftia work in pairs to collect expired Gifta, but Kazuki Kuwanomi, who is in charge of handling new employees, was not informed that Tsukasa was coming and thus did did not prepare a Giftia partner for him. Isla, the Giftia who met Tsukasa in the elevator previously, comes around to serve tea to the office, and is elected by the other office members to partner up with Tsukasa. The two, along with Tsukasa's trainer Michiru Kinushima and her partner Zack, go to collect a Giftia. Michiru tells Tsukasa that they are under legal obligation to collect Giftia before they expire. The group embarks on a subsequent job in which Isla is given a major role, but she fails the job, and in doing so causes a number of problems for the team. The team is then assigned a mission to retrieve Nina, a child-type Giftia owned by an old woman named Chizu. After multiple tries, Isla is unable to persuade Chizu to talk to them. Chizu overhears a conversation between Nina and Isla, during which Nina says that she feels it would be best if she is retrieved by the team. Chizu realizes she had not considered Nina's feelings in the matter and allows the team to retrieve her, but not before thanking her. Nina is then sent to the Terminal Service, where Giftia are gathered at the end of their lifespan. ",

    "synopsis": "Tsukasa meets Yasutaka Hanada, a spotter and a ten-year veteran at Terminal Service No. 1, whose aloof behavior surprises him. When Yasutaka asks him about how he got the job, Tsukasa reveals that his father is a friend of one of the higher-ups in the company, who decided to help him after he failed his entrance exams. Later on, after scolding Tsukasa for failing to retrieve a Giftia with Isla, Michiru vents her anger to Zack and Yasutaka before being asked by Kazuki about Isla's condition. Kazuki later takes Tsukasa out for a drink and asks him about his work compatibility with Isla, but deduces the communication problems between the two of them before even getting a response. She then apologizes for partnering Tsukasa with Isla and then expresses her frustration at ripping memories apart as part of her job. Tsukasa is then sent to the Unit Testing Room, where he meets Eru Miru and Mikijiro Tetsuguro, who are measuring Isla's physical skills. He then asks Isla about the physical training, and she tells him of her belief that she is holding him back because of all the time she spent off the field. Because of this, Tsukasa decides to do the negotiating with Giftia owners instead of Isla, in spite of the fact that it isn't what a spotter does. The next day, he begins putting together his own manual about owner negotiations and is assisted by Michiru and Zack. Once he is finished, he comes across Yasutaka, who learns about Isla's visits to the Unit Testing Room and remarks the pointless nature of those visits. When Tsukasa asks him about it, Yasutaka replies that Isla's physical capabilities are on a consistent decline that cannot be fixed, a characteristic of Giftia. Later on, Tsukasa and Isla successfully retrieve the Giftia they were previously assigned to, while Kazuki and Yasutaka talk about Isla's lifespan, which is set to expire in less than 2,000 hours, giving her less than three months to live.

However, he is unsettled by the fact that Isla repeatedly ignores him there. At Terminal Service No. 1, he confides to other employees about the problem, although their individual suggestions fail miserably at helping him attract her attention. Finally, Kazuki approaches Tsukasa about the problem and tells him she ignores other people during her personal time, not just him. She then tells him to take Isla out somewhere if he wants some interaction with her. Following through with the suggestion, he successfully asks Isla to accompany him to a shopping mall. There, they use the same elevator where they first met, and when Tsukasa asks her why she was using it that day, Isla replies that she had been visiting a herb shop at the mall's penthouse. They go to the shop and, to buy some more time, Tsukasa asks Isla to help him pick out some herbs as a present to a person who he unintentionally describes as being a lot like her. Afterwards, they go to a nearby amusement park, where Tsukasa admits the person he was describing was Isla herself. When he says he did this to make some memories with her about their partnership, she emotionally shuts down and tells him that she was not built to play at an amusement park, which shocks him. When Isla runs off, he purchases an item from the amusement park and gives it to her at their dorm room, telling her she can throw it away if she doesn't want it. ",

    "synopsis": "The Terminal Service No. 1 staff receives seven brand-new retrieval missions, and Tsukasa and Isla are assigned to retrieve a Giftia named Marcia. They are also warned of the presence of criminals who assume the identities of Terminal Service employees to retrieve Giftia and sell them on the black market. Tsukasa and Isla head to Marcia's residence, where they learn she is raising her owner, Souta, in the role of an older sister after his parents died. When Souta arrives home from school, he acts hostile towards Tsukasa and Isla, but is surprisingly willing to sign the agreement form to take Marcia away, citing that she is just a Giftia and adding that Giftias cannot be trusted in telling the truth. Unable to acquire a signature as a result of Souta's attitude, Tsukasa confides in Michiru about the encounter, and she advises him to solve the problem by having Souta believe he was truly loved by Marcia. As a result, Tsukasa, Isla, and Marcia decide to bake a cake for his birthday on the following day, and are assisted by Michiru and Zack. Afterwards, Michiru tells Tsukasa that she tried all she could to keep her father, a Giftia, from being retrieved, which resulted in him becoming a Wanderer, a Giftia that still retains its motor skills but loses its personality and memories, causing it to become instinctual and aggressive. Later, Souta returns home and is surprised by the group. Upon spotting the birthday cake, which was modeled after one used for his birthday three years ago, he remembers his family and tearfully apologies to Marcia. On the day before the retrieval, Souta is visited by a shady man, who claims to be Tsukasa and Isla's replacement from the Terminal Service and asks for Marcia. ",

Later, Tsukasa and Isla are contacted by Souta, who informs them about Marcia's disappearance, and they assume it is the work of a black market retriever. With only 24 hours left on Marcia's lifespan, Tsukasa resolves to retrieve Marcia and return her to Souta, and the rest of Terminal Service No. 1 joins the search. The following day, the office narrows down the search to an area where a black market retrieval service is possibly located, although their efforts are hindered by a unit from R. Security, a private security firm that was hired to assist in the investigation. Kazuki confronts the unit's supervisor, Shinonome, who gives her a map of the area under scrutiny. As the retrievers get ready to converge on the area, Tsukasa is equipped with and learns about a gun-like device designed to forcibly crash all of a Giftia's functions when they turn into Wanderers. He is then approached by Kazuki, who asks him if Isla will be able to handle the situation, but is forced to drop the subject soon afterward. Michiru later tells Tsukasa about how Kazuki tried to retrieve her father when he became a Wanderer, only for him to injure Kazuki and then be shot down by members of R. Security. Soon afterward, the black market retriever is found unconscious and it is concluded that Marcia turned into a Wanderer. Kazuki orders the rest of the retrievers to stop Marcia before she is destroyed by R. Security. Tsukasa and Isla find Marcia, only to realize Souta had been following them. Marcia then injures Isla and kidnaps Souta. Despite Isla's injuries, she and Tsukasa follow her to a rooftop, where Tsukasa nearly manages to convince Marcia to surrender.

With Isla now under maintenance for her injuries inflicted by Marcia, Tsukasa is reassigned to desk duty. After a visit from Tsukasa, Isla notes that he is still remaining optimistic despite what happened and privately questions his feelings about the situation. Once most of her maintenance is done, Isla returns to the office and realizes that she has been paying attention to Tsukasa a lot more closely lately.
