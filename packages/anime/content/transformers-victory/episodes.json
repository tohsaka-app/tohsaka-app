A roar from Deathsaurus's Tigerbreast prompts Leozack to cut to the chase and explain that he has just put a new information-gathering plan into motion. The target of this plan is the New Energy Resource Research and Development Laboratory in Japan, where new minerals from across the galaxy are studied to discern their energy potential, but intrusion into their computer system is immediately detected by one alert scientist. The scientist heads down to the lab's computer centre, where he spots a sinister shadow interfering with the computer core. When he demands the person show themselves, however, the scientist is shocked when a giant robotic bat reveals itself and smashes through the wall to the outside. Peering out the hole left by the creature, the scientist watches as it attaches itself to the chest of a waiting Decepticon, who introduces himself as the fifth member of the Breastforce—Hellbat! The scientist sounds the alarm and Autobot and human troops come running, but in the course of the fight, stray shots from the Autobot troopers ignite fuel tanks on the laboratory complex. As the area begins going up in flames, Hellbat eschews any further physical combat in exchange for a swift getaway, and, with an eerie chant, unleashes a hypnotic sonic wave that makes his opponents fall unconscious.",

    "synopsis": "With word coming in of Decepticon attacks in the Orient, the Autobots move the Shuttle Base to Japan. As Galaxy Shuttle departs on patrol, the watching Jean, Holi, Wingwaver and Dashtacker are distracted by the roars and shouts of Victory Leo, who is crashing and blasting his way through a nearby rocky outcrop. Wingwaver tells him that training is one thing, but to be careful not to destroy the base... only to be immediately silenced by the icy glare the feral Autobot shoots him. Dashtacker sighs that he can't think of Victory Leo as God Ginrai reborn, and Jean grows depressed again as he is reminded of this fact. The two Multiforcers head inside to rejoin Machtackle, who has just intercepted a coded Decepticon message. Decrypting the communiqué, they deduce that the Decepticons are targeting the geothermal power plant on Mount Asama and inform Star Saber that they are going to head out. The Supreme Commander (currently undergoing a mysterious procedure at the hands of Wheeljack, Perceptor and Minerva) orders them to stay, and instead dispatches Victory Leo, Holi and Jean, much to the Multiforce's chagrin.",

    "synopsis": "Deathsaurus issues his latest threat to the Autobots via video-tape, bragging that he has developed a super smart-missile that can strike anywhere in the world. The deadly projectiles are launched from an orbiting satellite and fire automatically, meaning that even Star Saber will be unable to reach the satellite in time to stop their launch. Deathsaurus quickly demonstrates by targeting Sambalpur, India, and despite the speed with which Star Saber issues emergency orders, the Multiforce and Rescue Team arrive at the location only seconds before the missile impacts. Upon impact, the missile detonates and scatters multiple smaller missiles across the immediate area, hitting Kathmandu, Calcutta, the Bay of Bengal and the Deccan Plateau, causing widespread devastation. After providing aid in Kathmandu, the Rescue Team and Multiforce head for Calcutta, after being given one strict order by Star Saber: Do not engage any Decepticons under any circumstances. This is Deathsaurus's true goal—using the threat of his new missiles to stay the Autobots' hand so that his forces can freely gather as much energy as they want.",

After a tense moment, Deathsaurus calms down and drops Leozack, instructing the Decepticons to focus their efforts on destroying Star Saber and Victory Leo. Gōryū grins widely, chuckling to himself that he'll be able to show up Leozack with a new plan he has come up with...",
