    "synopsis": "Stunned by Koko's words, Banri awaits Koko at the same spot he was rejected by her, hoping Koko would come back for him. Hours passed and Banri meets Koko's father, who drives Banri home. Along the way, Banri deduces that Koko may already had knowledge of Banri taking anti-anxiety medications and is asking her father of the diagnosis that leads to its prescription. Being dropped off, Banri encounters Nana, who Banri confides with for his recent dilemma. The next day, encouraged by Nana's words the other night, Banri plans to confront Koko. Afterwards, Banri is met by Koko, seemingly acting the same whenever the two interact. However, after meeting up with their friends, Koko nonchalantly declares that she and Banri had broken up, much to the shock and bewilderment of Banri and the others. After Koko lashes out on them, Chinami tells Banri that Koko may had seen the clip of Banri in his anxiety attack at his apartment from Chinami's camera the other night. Staying optimistic, Banri later informs Linda and the president of the Festival club of his breakup with Koko and is followed with Banri and Linda having a serious argument, in which Banri reveals to Mitsuo his past relationship with Linda and apologizes for not telling him. Koko then appears as she hands down a letter of resignation from the club to its president until Banri cuts her off, causing her to leave with Banri calling out to Koko. ",

    "synopsis": "Banri confronts Koko; Koko explains the reason why she decided to resign from the Festival Club is due to Banri's unwillingness to be in the same place as her. Banri reveals to Koko that his memories from before his accident are returning and he would eventually return to his former self; his memories since the accident by then will disappear. After Banri thanked Koko for all they'd shared together, the two agreed to become friends with Koko revoking her resignation from the club. Moreover, Koko promises Banri that she will stay by Banri's side as long as Banri won't forget Koko. Afterwards, Banri tries to patch things up with Mitsuo, who had not contacted Banri since he revealed to Mitsuo his past with Linda. Meanwhile, with their school festival fast approaching, Banri's condition worsens, much to Koko's fright. Nijigen, bewildered by his friends actions and is feeling left out of what's happening, intends to have a get-together with the gang for the sake of reviving their friendship. After being agreed upon, Banri later suffers another memory break and runs off — calling out desperately for Linda. After returning to his senses, Banri plans to return to his hometown, feeling certain that his memories and former self will return. During their school festival, the festival club receives support from the private school committee thanks to Mitsuo's efforts. Meanwhile, Banri was able to reconcile with Mitsuo. During the Awa dance performance, Banri narrates how moments and feelings are born and later die.

    "synopsis": "Upon losing all his memories since his accident just after their Awa dance performance during their school festival, Banri returns to his hometown. After fiddling with the notes he made for himself prior to the return of his former memories, Banri opens his e-mail account and discovers that someone has been sending e-mails to his ex-girlfriend, Kōko Kaga, under his name. Linda and Banri seem to have returned to their easy friendship, with Linda spending Christmas with the Tada family. While contemplating on Linda's reply to his feelings for her, and the happenings that occurred between them since his accident, Kōko arrives at Banri's home. After having Banri mistake her for Chinami, Kōko hands Banri a DVD and his cracked mirror case, which Banri mistakes as Kōko's belonging and returns it to her. After asking for directions for the bridge where Banri fell, Kōko leaves and Banri finally remembers Kōko after finding the same mirror case — that belonged to Kōko — alongside his notes. As a result, Banri goes after Kōko to the bridge where he meets his conflicted former self. The latter then manages to cross over after Linda appeared and gave her reply to his feelings with a \"Yes\" and he hands Banri the ring he dropped at the bridge days before. Afterwards, Banri embraces Kōko and the two recall their promise: that as long as they remember one another, the two will stay together for the rest of their lives. They profess their love for one another and Banri presents his ring to Kōko, which she gladly accepts. Meanwhile, it's revealed that Nijigen was responsible for sending spam e-mails as Banri and motivated Kōko to go after him. Taking advantage of Kōko's motivation, Chinami edited the recording Banri made of himself and burned it to a DVD, which she asked Kōko to deliver to Banri. While watching his recording, Banri thanks Kōko for being by his side. Banri later returns to Tokyo and attends university with his friends. His relationship with Kōko is still intact and going strong. Mitsuo and Linda are shown flirting while Koko and Banri kiss with Koko wearing the ring Banri gave her. ",
