The next day, Narumi finds that Meo has disappeared with the money. Despite Alice's warnings, he rushes off to find her. When he finds her, they are attacked by the Yakuza. Narumi is getting beaten up, but then the guys from the dojo show up to dish out some pain. Realizing his weakness, Narumi asks the Fourth, leader of the dojo, to perform a sake ritual with him to formally induct him into the dojo. With that done, there is still the problem of the money Meo has. However, Narumi gets the idea to split the money into small portions and transfer them all into Kusakabe's bank account (Kusakabe is Meo's father), scheduling all of it to be transferred to the corporation that's after Meo, the Kishiwada Corporation. Because the money is dirty, it will cause problems for the Yakuza members. The Yakuza freak out, but Narumi later reveals that it was just a bluff. However, the company is forced to bring Kusakabe to stop the “transaction”, as the account is in his name. When they show up, the Fourth and the guys from the dojo proceed to beat the crap out of them. Meo shows up, and Kusakabe breaks free after seeing her. Distracted by the touching scene, Narumi gets punched in the face by Tetsu (his own ally). The next day, Narumi arrives to find Meo preparing to go out with her father in Alice's room, much to Alice's dismay. However, the case is closed and everyone lives happily ever after. ",

Turns out one of the band's former promoters is the Yanagihara Group, who have ties with the Yakuza. The band didn't want that group to sponsor them, so they turned to the Fourth. However, it's possible that the Yanagihara Group bites back. Narumi starts to promote and help out with the concert.

Also, Alice shows up, having worried about Narumi because he didn't pick up his phone and his GPS was by the fire. The Fourth also calls Narumi to ask him about the fire as well as tell him that they have found the one who stole their t-shirts in the last episode. Narumi shows up to see the culprit, and the culprit starts saying random things about angels and mentions Hirasaka.

That night, Narumi gets a call from Renji asking him to meet up and return his shirt. Before he goes, he visits Alice, who tells him about the evil of Hirasaka Renji. Narumi still intends to return the shirt, though, which causes Alice to start throwing things at him. She then gives him one of her stuffed animals, an owl that will “protect” him, and lets him sleep on her bed that night with her. The next day, Narumi leaves without the shirt, knowing that Renji will just disappear if he just gives it up. The episode ends with him meeting up with Renji, saying that they need to talk.",

Renji starts to tell him, revealing that the Fourth and him lived together with a girl named Hison before. The two men had an agreement that neither would make a move on Hison and that both would protect her from other men. Renji tells Narumi that the Fourth used Hison as a shield in a fight against the Gotouda Group, causing her death. Renji vows revenge and tells Narumi to stay out of it. Narumi later talks with Yoshiki, who tells him a bit about the Fourth. Narumi realizes how much the Fourth cared about Renji and calls him to beg him to ask Alice for help. The Fourth later comes by the ramen shop to finally ask Alice to help him out, and he finds out that the other NEETs were already on it. Narumi confronts the Fourth about Hison, but the Fourth refuses to tell him more. He later asks Alice, who warns him that investigating may cause him to lose a friend, but he chooses to do so anyway. Narumi later finds out from Hiroaki that on the day of Hison's death, the Fourth was seen with a bleeding shoulder as well. More importantly, there were reports of another woman's voice coming from the apartment. He rushes over to the Fourth to find that the butterfly tattoo on his shoulder actually covers that scar, so he concludes that the men were actually after Hison, not the Fourth. The Fourth refuses to tell him anything, so he goes to talk with Alice again, who tells him that the Gotouda Group's leader divorced his wife right after Hison's death, which leads her to conclude that the culprit is the ex-wife. She also concludes that Hison was pregnant, due to the fact that she was stabbed in the abdomen. Alice tells Narumi that he needs to hurry and tell Renji the truth about the incident, but Narumi gets a call as he leaves that the Fourth has been attacked.",

Alice appears to reveal that the embroidery on Renji's real shirt is the same as that of Narumi's concert shirt. She concludes that they must have been made by the same person. Alice reveals that Hison survived, but lost her womb in the incident, and that she is actually the owner of the shop Narumi had visited so many times, having taken the name Yoshiki.

Major argues against them, and they propose a gamble with the loser backing off, which Tetsu agrees to immediately. They point at a Powerebo machine and say they will use baseball to decide the winner and Major accepts. However, Major doesn't realize that they are talking about a real baseball game.

The day of the game approaches, and Alice reveals that their opponents are quite the tough bunch. Narumi reveals to the rest of the NEETs that Nemo was formerly a baseball player. The day of the game arrives, and the NEETs start strong with the Fourth's pitching, but Nemo comes out to hit a home run on the first pitch. The NEET Teddy Bears are able to stay relatively even with the Yakuza team, but Nemo has yet to pitch. The Fourth is reaching his limit, and Alice laments the lack of data on Nemo, so Narumi rushes back to the arcade to check if the game has any information. Finally, Nemo comes to the mound. With the Fourth out of commission, two outs, and a runner on first, Narumi steps up to bat in the Fourth's place. However, Alice finally comes out into the open to take Narumi's place. Nemo has trouble with the first couple of pitches, but gets three strikes on Alice. However, the last pitch is not caught and Alice makes a break for the bases. Narumi then finally steps up to bat, hitting foul ball after foul ball. Finally, on the 21st pitch, Narumi is able to hit the ball cleanly and win the game. When Nemo comes to demand how Narumi knew his style, Narumi reveals that it was all present in Powerebo. The next day, Major is on a major losing streak in Powerebo, and Narumi notices that the opposing team is actually Alice.

The next day, Narumi skips school, and Ayaka starts to worry. The two apologize to each other, and Narumi gives her a new armband to replace the one he accidentally ripped the day before.

Alice tells him that she knows why she would want to kill herself, but doesn't know why she chose the school roof, which was too low to ensure death. Just like Narumi, Alice blames herself for not stopping Ayaka, but Narumi is able to comfort her. She then officially makes Narumi her assistant for this case. The next day, Alice orders Narumi to go to the greenhouse, where the Fourth is waiting.

However, Alice first shows him a picture of Hakamizaka Shirou, who Narumi recognizes as the person who was talking with Toshi last episode. She concludes that he is the man who created Angel Fix, having mutated a flower that he found while studying abroad to create it. Toshi was one of Hakamizaka's distributors, using Ayaka to grow the raw ingredients. The Fourth mobilizes everyone under him to create a giant search party for those responsible for Angel Fix. Narumi later tells the other NEETs his theory that Ayaka overheard what they were talking about before and realized that she had been helping grow narcotics. He believes that it is possible that Ayaka spoke to Toshi that night, so he resolves to find out, sending the NEETs out to find him. That night, Narumi receives a call from Toshi from Ayaka's phone, confirming his theory that they met. Toshi sounds crazed, but he tries to arrange a meeting with Narumi.
